Despite advertising Du Wors’ legal expertise regarding corporate governance and intellectual property, Du Wors will take extreme effort to rape the coffers of your company and control your property. He has been repeatedly sued for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and malpractice. Although he has escaped judgment at the time of this writing. There exists two pending lawsuits against him both including dishonesty and one for breach of fiduciary duty. In addition to his unethical and cowardly conduct, he has beaten his daughter and wife which has resulted in criminal charges and plea deals. It is amazing that he has not been disbarred. We can be patient, for it is inevitable.

Keep an eye out for updates to this blog, we will include criminal complaints, civil complaints, bar complaints, and other bad acts by Du Wors and his colleagues.

Du Wor’s recent effort to intimidate and bully Houson Wade to take down his Facebook page and Twitter comments through legal action bombed. Listen to the whining of Du Wors – a midst his crying – he reluctantly admits his criminal and abusive conduct.
